# Celestial Editor
There are many image editors and animators out there. Yet, there is a lack of image editors that handle pixel art well. Consequently, pixel artists use image editors that weren’t built for making pixel art, wasting hours on workarounds and unwanted behavior. What I hope to create is a specialized pixel image editor with animation capabilities that speeds up the workflow of artists, allowing them to have a higher sprite throughput. Not only that, but novice artists like me can have a friendly introduction to the pixel art world. Using the right tool for the job will definitely speed up the process; you don’t use a knife to hammer a nail – do you?

## Main Features

### Color Palette
The main strength of the program resides in the colors layering mechanism. Each pixel drawn will be linked to a color layer in the palette; and once this color layer is modified (either by changing its color or deleted altogether), all the pixels drawn using that layer will be modified accordingly.

### Frames
Frames represent the sub-images in an animation sequence.

### Animation
Other than the recoloring ability, an appealing quality of the program is the ability to create animations easily. This is achieved by drawing the animation live as it is being played; the frames cycle through and you draw on whatever frame that is currently displayed – draw it as you see it! This feature combined with the recoloring ability shall revolutionize how pixel art is drawn.

### Suite of Brushes and Tools
Lots of brushes and tools to speed up your workflow and much more coming in the near future.

### Onion Skinning
While animating, it is helpful to see hints of the previous frame to allow the animator decide how to create or change the image.

## Inspiration
Pixel art is a relatively new development in the art industry, which originated from the computer limitations in the early 1970s. Pong and Super Mario are the prime examples of iconic pixel art in the 16-bit era. However, Super Mario had colorized pixel art, unlike Pong which was only black and white. It always astonishes me how a 16x16 image of Mario is recognized by almost everyone; who would have thought a minimalist approach to aesthetics would have an immense impact on the gaming community. Nevertheless, some people despise pixel art as it does not abide with their everyday lives of ultra high-definition eyes. Still, it is extremely difficult to create lively characters that jump around and have an interesting personality using only a 16x16 image; in fact, I believe it is a magical. Honoring the glorious 16-bit era, my project targets a niche part of the digital art industry – pixels artists and 2D game artists.
